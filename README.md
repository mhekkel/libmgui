Libmgui
=======

This library provides a cross platform application framework. Well, there's currently only one working platform which is GTK4, but reviving the Windows code should be possible. It is on the todo list.

The library uses a strict division between client code that is OS agnostic and implementation code using bridge patterns.

There's no documentation yet.
